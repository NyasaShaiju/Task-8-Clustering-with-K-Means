Task-8-Clustering-with-K-Means
This project demonstrates unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customers dataset. Key steps include:
Selecting relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score)
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
Visualizing the customer segments with color-coded clusters
Evaluating cluster quality using the Silhouette Score
The clustering helps identify distinct groups of customers based on their spending habits and income levels, which can be useful for targeted marketing strategies.
